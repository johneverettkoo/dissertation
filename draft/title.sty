I would like to first thank my advisors Michael W. Trosset and Minh Tang, whose leadership and insight have shaped and guided my research journey. 
I met Michael as a first year MSSS student taking his class on high dimensional data analysis, where he challenged us to investigate an open problem. 
From the way in which I went about my solution, he was able to identify my strengths and weaknesses as a novice researcher and provide me with additional problems suited to my abilities and interests. 
It was through Michael that I met Minh, who became my co-advisor. 
Much of my work is owed to following the breadcrumbs of intuition that Minh scattered for me in strategic locations. 
Both Michael and Minh have been exceedingly patient with me as I sniffed out the paths that they set forth and slowly arrived at my own solutions. 
I am indebted to their kindness, persistence, and wisdom. 

I would like to extend my gratitude toward my research committee members, Julia Fukuyama, Roni Khardon, and Fangzheng Xie. 
I spent much of my time at IU as a TA in Julia's computational statistics class, and I learned much from watching her teach and work with students. 
Roni's machine learning classes provided me with insight on using probabilistic and statistical methods outside the classical statistics setting, and PAC learning in particular has helped me understand my research objectives. 
Fangzheng always asks insightful questions and challenges me with perspectives I hadn't considered. 

None of this would have been possible without Dana Fielding and Kelly Hanna, whose work behind the scenes has been invaluable in making my time at IU smooth and pleasant. 
I do not think I would have been able to complete anything as a graduate student without their help and encouragement.

Graph and network data, in which samples are represented not as a collection of feature vectors but as relationships between pairs of observations, are increasingly widespread in various fields ranging from analyzing data in the social sciences to training machine learning models for artificial intelligence tasks. 
One common goal of analyzing graph data is community detection or graph clustering, in which the graph is partitioned into disconnected subgraphs in an unsupervised yet meaningful manner (e.g., by optimizing an objective function or recovering unobserved labels). 
Because traditional clustering techniques were developed for data that can be represented as vectors, they cannot be applied directly to graphs. 
In this research, we investigate the use of a family of spectral decomposition based approaches for community detection in block models (random graph models with inherent community structure), first by demonstrating how under the generalized random dot product graph framework, all block models can be represented as a collection of feature vectors organized by community, applying clustering methods for these feature vector representations by exploiting the linear structures that the block models induce, and finally deriving the asymptotic properties of these methods. 
We further extend this connection between block models and community-organized generalized random dot product graphs to propose more flexible, nonlinear community structures, using real graphs with nonlinear structures as motivating examples.
