Graph and network data, in which samples are represented not as a collection of feature vectors but as relationships between pairs of observations, are increasingly widespread in various fields ranging from sociology to computer vision. One common goal of analyzing graph data is community detection or graph clustering, in which the graph is partitioned into disconnected subgraphs in an unsupervised yet meaningful manner (e.g., by optimizing an objective function or recovering unobserved labels). Because traditional clustering techniques were developed for data that can be represented as vectors, they cannot be applied directly to graphs. In this research, we investigate the use of a family of spectral decomposition based approaches for community detection in block models (random graph models with inherent community structure), first by demonstrating how under the Generalized Random Dot Product Graph framework, all graphs generated by block models can be represented as feature vectors, then applying clustering methods for these feature vector representations, and finally deriving the asymptotic properties of these methods.
