Graph and network data, in which samples are represented not as a collection of feature vectors but as relationships between pairs of observations, are increasingly widespread in various fields ranging from analyzing data in the social sciences to training machine learning models for artificial intelligence tasks. 
One common goal of analyzing graph data is community detection or graph clustering, in which the graph is partitioned into disconnected subgraphs in an unsupervised yet meaningful manner (e.g., by optimizing an objective function or recovering unobserved labels). 
Because traditional clustering techniques were developed for data that can be represented as vectors, they cannot be applied directly to graphs. 
In this research, we investigate the use of a family of spectral decomposition based approaches for community detection in block models (random graph models with inherent community structure), first by demonstrating how under the generalized random dot product graph framework, all block models can be represented as a collection of feature vectors organized by community, applying clustering methods for these feature vector representations by exploiting the linear structures that the block models induce, and finally deriving the asymptotic properties of these methods. 
We further extend this connection between block models and community-organized generalized random dot product graphs to propose more flexible, nonlinear community structures, using real graphs with nonlinear structures as motivating examples.
