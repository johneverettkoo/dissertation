Thanks for coming to my dissertation defense. 
The topic of my dissertation is community detection in the setting of generalized random dot product graphs.

This presentation contains three sections. 
First, I'll go through some preliminaries and introduce two families of random graph models and how they are related. 
The second section is about the relationship between two types of random graphs, namely how the popularity adjusted block model is a generalized random dot product graph, and how that relationship can be exploited for community detection and parameter estimation.
Third, I'll end by introducing a new type of random graph model, why it is of interest, and how we could perform statistical inference on this model.

So, onto the preliminaries of random graph models. 
Suppose we observe a graph with community structure. 
In this example is a friendship network among faculty members at a university in the UK. 
In this graph, the vertices represent the individual faculty and the edges represent whether pairs of faculty are friends. 
This dataset also comes with school affiliation for each faculty member, but let's say we do not know this information and we want to be able to infer it. 
This type of problem is called graph clustering or community detection. 

To perform this task within the context of statistical inference, we first need to define a model. 
One such type of model for undirected and unweighted graphs is called the bernoulli random graph. 
If we describe this graph by an n by n adjacency matrix A, which contains entries 1 where there is an edge between its corresponding pair of vertices and 0 otherwise, we say A describes a bernoulli random graph if there is a corresponding n by n edge probability matrix P such that each A_ij is drawn as bernoulli P_ij.

Let's build on this to graphs with community structure. 
We begin by assigning each vertex of the graph community labels which can take on values from 1 to K. 
Then if each P_ij is a function of z_i and z_j, alohg with some other parameters specific to vertices i and j, we call this a block model. 
The simpliest and most popular example of this is the stochastic block model, which has a fixed edge probability for each pair of communities. 
In this particular example, we have two communities, so K = 2 and each z_i can take on values 1 or 2. 
Then we set each P_ij as p if both i and j are in community 1, q if they are both in community 2, or r if they are in different communities.
